If unsuccessful, the caster can be injured due to the released energy or even, in case of a Critical Failure (W1), create a tiny grief that haunts people or the place. The energy charges here vary with the type of soul being processed: - Animal (such as dogs, wolves, or mountain lions) = 2-3 charges- Large animal (such as cows, bears, or mammoths) = 4-5 charges- Conscious being (such as humans, dwarves, or orcs) = 9-13 charges Higher, conscious being (such as elves or draconids) = 15-20 charges- Otherworldly being (such as demons) = 25-50 chargesGhosts, souls whose deaths occurred long ago, are usually only half as productive.</td> <td>Caster Pocket</td> <td>1 Charge 1 Soul</td></tr> <tr><td>Separate Soul</td> <td>Risky ritual that, if successful (MP vs. often high SG), separates an undesirable character trait (such as irrational fears or a philia) from the target's mind.

As a result, person and object are connected. The person then always knows where the connection is, gets +3 on all rolls (like AW, VW for weapons or craft for tools), +25% damage and more, but also suffers from strange stress effects and bizarre emotions. If the item is also destroyed, the soul mate suffers immense feedback effects, such as great grief and -10 to all rolls and this for weeks or months. He will feel for the rest of his life as if he had lost a child or beloved pet.Person to Person: The caster extends the souls of two targets and implants a part in the other. Both persons will now become much closer and instinctively understand each other as siblings or lovers. They sense where approximately the other is and how he is doing there. Stress they share or intercept each other, while in each other's presence they receive +2 to all rolls. However, can also lead to madness, such as a growing desire to eat the other person. If one soul mate dies, the other suffers a huge knockback and can blunt them into a psychopath (PY vs SG 20) or make them insane (PY vs SG 10).</td> <td>Casting Stone</td> <td>5 Charges</td></tr> <tr><td>Imprint Sense Stone</td> <td>Marks an empty soul stone with a memory or experience of the caster or (if successful: MP vs. SG) of a target, thus converting it to a sense stone.
