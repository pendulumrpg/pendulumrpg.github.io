This is similar to learning a resistance SG: Authority (AU) vs SG per activity. If this drops to zero, the animal is tamed or at least bonded to the character and can be used as a support animal. Occasionally, risky trusts may be attempted, which may accelerate progress, but may also end with the animal being attacked by or escaping.Note: During the time of taming, the animal must be fed or held captive.</td> <td>-</td> <td>-</td></tr></tbody></table></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
