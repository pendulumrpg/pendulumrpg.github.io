extended by the worshipped power source.</p> <p>Domain: Upper category of disciplines, contains three subcategories each, called disciplines.</p> <p>Casting Form (WF): Is the way a spell is cast - whether it is projected or manipulates an event.</p> <p>Domains and Affiliation</p> <p>A priest character must first choose a primary domain (such as light, fire, night, nature, darkness, or the deep) from which to draw his power. Any disciplines learned within it (each requiring only one skill point to unlock) automatically expand as the domain itself increases.

The undead draws its life energy from the environment, which slightly weakens not only the caster, but also all other beings in the immediate vicinity. If the construct is released, the caster dies or gets lost, it reduces within a few days or weeks to a simple revenant, which attacks everything living that crosses its path.Combination: If the spirit of the dead was called before, it can be locked into its old body and resurrected as an undead servant. This even has its old intelligence and values and can perform more complex tasks or even learn new ones.
