Inferior food or poor sleeping arrangements do not cause stress.</td> <td>-2</td></tr> <tr><td>Dragon Blood</td> <td>Dragon fire pulses in the character's veins (not selectable by draconids) Grants immunity to disease and corruption.

Considered proof of nobility in many places, is highly regarded.</td> <td>-4</td></tr> <tr><td>Fairy Blood</td> <td>The magical blood of a fairy pulsates in the veins of the character: Grants magical affinity and allows to sense magic unerringly.  Grants casters +2 to all magical identifications.  Beasts must overcome before attacking the character (PY vs SG 22).</td> <td>-3</td></tr> <tr><td>Blessed</td> <td>Whether by divine blessing or pure chance, the character is unnaturally lucky: A W19 already counts as a Critical Success or Critical Hit.  Luck happens to the character more often, misfortune to his allies first.</td> <td>-8</td></tr> <tr><td>Clairvoyant</td> <td>The character has clairvoyant abilities:  Occasionally, useful visions can reach the character (lucky roll).  These visions can also be forced, e.g. by meditation or drugs.</td> <td>-5</td></tr> <tr><td>Nature Boy</td> <td>Sympathetic Relationship to Forests and Dense Vegetation:Spending time in a forest reduces one stress point once per rest.</td> <td>-3</td></tr> <tr><td>Masochism</td> <td>The pleasure of or self-affirmation through pain: A hurtful hit can reduce stress (SG 15). A knockout or immense pain can no longer cause stress. The character may be prone to self-injurious behavior (BE vs SG)</td> <td>-3</td></tr> <tr><td>Optimistic</td> <td>A basic positive attitude (cannot be combined with Melancholy): With every rest a stress point is automatically solved.</td> <td>-5</td></tr> <tr><td>Philantropy</td> <td>The character is a philanthropist: Helping a person noticeably solves one stress point.</td> <td>-1</td></tr> <tr><td>Photophilia</td> <td>The character loves bright light: Grants +2 to all casts in daylight or comparable brightness.</td> <td>-2</td></tr> <tr><td>Keen Instinct</td> <td>The character has a keen instinct or gut feeling.

On the other hand, if the sleep is disturbed, the character suffers 2 stress points.</td> <td>-3</td></tr> <tr><td>Animal Lover</td> <td>Deep sympathy for animals, especially animal companions: If an animal companion is present, one stress point is released per day.  If that companion dies, the character suffers 10 stress or even trauma.</td> <td>-1</td></tr> <tr><td>Titan Blood</td> <td>The character has the blood of a Titan: Titan machinery recognizes the character as a Titan.  Grants 3 on all luck rolls.</td> <td>-5</td></tr> <tr><td>Inconspicuous</td> <td>The character rarely makes an impression on others, and then only slightly:  He is rarely thought of or talked about.  Therefore, he is rarely associated with events or crimes.  Grants +2 Infiltration (IF).</td> <td>-2</td></tr> <tr><td>Trustworthy</td> <td>The character has a trustworthy aura: Grants +3 Rhetoric (RH) for each conviction during the first impression. The character is less likely to be associated with crimes.</td> <td>-3</td></tr></tbody></table> <h2 id="properties-neutral"><a href="#properties-neutral" class="header-anchor">#</a> Properties, neutral</h2> <table><thead><tr><th>Name</th> <th>Description / Effect</th> <th>AP</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Atronach Body</td> <td>The character has a magic repelling body: Healing spells do not work on the character.  Potions of any kind often have only 50% of their effect on the character.  Physical spells (like fireballs) often achieve only 50% of their effect.  Arcane, purely magical spells, as well as magical runes or artifacts have no effect and no effect at all. For example, a magic sword is just a sword.</td> <td>0</td></tr> <tr><td>Conspicuous</td> <td>The character is quickly remembered, both positively and negatively: He is often thought of and talked about.  However, he is also quickly associated with events or crimes.</td> <td>0</td></tr> <tr><td>Bipolar</td> <td>The character goes through severe mood swings every day:  Must toss each happiness to see if his mood lifts (and he drops a stress point) or lowers (and he suffers a stress point).  May have a disruptive effect on his companions (on a Critical Failure, for example).</td> <td>0</td></tr> <tr><td>God-fearing</td> <td>The character is deeply convinced of his religion: Prayer can have a stress-reducing effect once a day (SG 15).  Violation of his faith (even by party members or others) can cause slight to even immense stress increase.</td> <td>0</td></tr> <tr><td>Uniformity</td> <td>Considered Lifestyle of Caution and Restraint: A W1 does not count as a Critical Failure, a W20 does not count as a Critical Hit.  A W1 in combat still damages the weapon.</td> <td>0</td></tr> <tr><td>Cannibalism</td> <td>The morbid interest in consuming one's own kind: Consuming the flesh of one's own kind causes stress.  May become obsessive, causing the character to suffer stress (of variable amounts) if he does not eat anyone.</td> <td>0</td></tr> <tr><td>Kleptomania</td> <td>The compulsive desire to steal: Grants +2 theft (DB) due to routine.  A successful theft can reduce one stress point every four hours (SG 20).  Occasionally, the character experiences an incredible need to steal an item. If he does not pursue this, he suffers at least 2 stress points.</td> <td>0</td></tr> <tr><td>Necrophilia</td> <td>The sometimes compulsive pleasure of killing: A kill can relieve stress (animals SG 22, people SG 10).

Torturing a person can release up to three stress points (SG 10, 15, 20).  However, can become obsessive, causing the character to suffer stress (of variable amount) when not tormenting anyone.</td> <td>0</td></tr> <tr><td>Fateful</td> <td>Critical successes as well as critical failures cause significantly more effect.</td> <td>0</td></tr> <tr><td>Voice of the Dead</td> <td>The character speaks to the dead ... and they also to him: He is able to summon the soul of a dead person and speak to them.  In turn, he can also be spoken to or even haunted by them.  Near graveyards, battlefields, tragedies, and other places potentially haunted by tormented souls, a lucky roll determines visits from the afterlife.  A W5 or below in this case means a spirit that causes stress. However, it is rarely dangerous.</td> <td>0</td></tr></tbody></table> <h2 id="properties-negative"><a href="#properties-negative" class="header-anchor">#</a> Properties, negative</h2> <table><thead><tr><th>Name</th> <th>Description / Effect</th> <th>AP</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Ablutomania</td> <td>Heavy washing and cleanliness compulsion: Being dirty causes one stress point per rest.

Can also cause stress at low altitude (PY vs SG)</td> <td>+1</td></tr> <tr><td>Alchuophobia</td> <td>Fear of darkness (and what lurks in it): Activities in twilight cause 1 stress, in darkness even 2. When traveling, the campfire must be lit before sunset.</td> <td>+3</td></tr> <tr><td>Algophobia</td> <td>The Fear of Pain: Causes every rest stress as long as the character is below 100% of his health points.</td> <td>+5</td></tr> <tr><td>Nightmares</td> <td>Nightmares plague the character at night: A lucky roll each sleep determines whether the nightmares return. On 10 and below the character suffers stress, on a Critical Failure (W1) even 3.</td> <td>+2</td></tr> <tr><td>Aquaphobia</td> <td>Pronounced fear of bodies of water, but not of water in general:  Crossing a body of water on a bridge causes 1 stress.  Crossing a body of water on a boat or ship causes 2 stress.  Going into a body of water causes at least 2 to 5 stress (SG 20, 25, 30).</td> <td>+3</td></tr> <tr><td>Atychophobia</td> <td>Pronounced fear of making mistakes, up to neurotic perfectionism: Each failed roll causes out of combat can cause 1 stress point (PY vs SG 22).  A knockout, on the other hand, causes 5 (instead of only 3) stress points.</td> <td>+8</td></tr> <tr><td>Employment Neurosis</td> <td>Moderate Activity Neurosis, Inner Restlessness: Even short periods of inactivity (from about 20 minutes) can make the character nervous and require a Luck Roll. At 11 and above, only the character suffers a stress point, at 10 and below, the entire party.</td> <td>+3</td></tr> <tr><td>Hemorrhage Disease</td> <td>Mild, but still hemorrhage disease that causes wounds to close more slowly.

Surgical procedures on the character suffer a malus of 4.</td> <td>+8</td></tr> <tr><td>Dysmorphophobia</td> <td>Pronounced Fear of Disfigurement: Each injurious hit causes 1 stress.  Scars or openly visible fractures can cause permanent stress per rest.</td> <td>+5</td></tr> <tr><td>Epilepsy</td> <td>Each stress increase can cause an epileptic seizure. For this, the player must roll Luck:  W1 is a severe epileptic seizure and equal to a knockout (including deduction of all hit points).  W2 to W10 is a mild seizure, causing only one stress point.  W11 and above with no effect. A W20 means to be spared from seizures until the next rest.</td> <td>+8</td></tr> <tr><td>Haematophobia</td> <td>Pronounced Fear of Blood: Causes one stress point at the sight of blood.  Causes 2 stress points when seeing one's own blood.</td> <td>+5</td></tr> <tr><td>Hydrargyophobia</td> <td>Fear of Medication and Affecting One's Body: Causes one stress point when the character ingests a healing potion, uses a talisman, or has a spell cast on him.</td> <td>+4</td></tr> <tr><td>Hylophobia</td> <td>The fear of forests and dense vegetation (cannot be combined with Nature Boy): Entering a forest causes a variable amount of stress every day.</td> <td>+3</td></tr> <tr><td>Insomnia</td> <td>Sleep disturbance up to insomnia: The character regenerates only half of his stamina (EN) with each rest.</td> <td>+2</td></tr> <tr><td>Claustrophobia</td> <td>The fear of confined spaces, isolation, and being trapped: Going into narrow, dangerous corridors or rooms, exposing oneself to the danger of being trapped, so to speak, causes a stress point.  Being locked in causes large amounts of stress (2 or more).  Simply entering a house does not cause stress.</td> <td>+3</td></tr> <tr><td>Corrupted Blood</td> <td>The character is incurably infected with corruption:  Every day, the character's corruption increases by 1%.  Grants immunity to poison, disease, mind attacks, and further corruption.  From 50%, stepping on consecrated ground is painful.</td> <td>+8</td></tr> <tr><td>Unstable</td> <td>Strongly sensitive to influences, often an artist's soul: Grants +10 Consciousness (BE).

For example, a theft in a city requires one stress point, a burglary two, while a clandestine murder requires three.  In villages, forests and away from judicial traceability, the stress probability decreases.</td> <td>+6</td></tr> <tr><td>Bewitched</td> <td>The character is haunted by bad luck:  A W2 already counts as a Critical Failure.  Setbacks and misfortunes (like an ambush) hit the character more often.</td> <td>+8</td></tr> <tr><td>Spoiled</td> <td>The character comes from a good home and / or knows no deprivation: Mediocre or poor daily rations inevitably cause stress.  Menial tasks (such as crafting or stockpiling) cause stress.  Inadequate sleeping pad (e.g. mat and sleeping bag) cause stress.</td> <td>+5</td></tr></tbody></table></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"><!----></div></div>
